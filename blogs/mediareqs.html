            Pinegrove as a band has the remarkable ability to stir emotions
            within me that other artists simply can&#39;t. Their music strikes a
            perfect balance between looking towards the future, while holding
            onto a nostalgic past. Need 2 is what got me into listening to
            Pinegrove. The lyrics (only 10 lines!) paired with the charming
            atmosphere of the song, is able to strike a chord every single time.
            It really manages to capture the &quot;raw human experience&quot;.
            <br />
            No matter how often I come back to this song, it always gives me
            that same comforting feeling.

            Yes, here’s another song by Pinegrove. I just discovered it
            yesterday while exploring some material for my previous review. This
            time, the track dates back to 2012! <br />
            This song captures a similar feeling as &quot;Need 2&quot; does,
            although it isn&#39;t as well-known. I especially love the soothing
            harmony towards the end, around &quot;No we won&#39;t leave this
            town&quot;. It manages to evoke such a nostalgic feeling only
            Pinegrove is able to create. The exact feeling is quite
            indescribable. With that being said, I would rate this song a 5/5,
            without a doubt. I truly wish I could listen to it again for the
            first time
