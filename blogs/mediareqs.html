            Pinegrove as a band has the remarkable ability to stir emotions
            within me that other artists simply can&#39;t. Their music strikes a
            perfect balance between looking towards the future, while holding
            onto a nostalgic past. Need 2 is what got me into listening to
            Pinegrove. The lyrics (only 10 lines!) paired with the charming
            atmosphere of the song, is able to strike a chord every single time.
            It really manages to capture the &quot;raw human experience&quot;.
            <br />
            No matter how often I come back to this song, it always gives me
            that same comforting feeling.

            Yes, here’s another song by Pinegrove. I just discovered it
            yesterday while exploring some material for my previous review. This
            time, the track dates back to 2012! <br />
            This song captures a similar feeling as &quot;Need 2&quot; does,
            although it isn&#39;t as well-known. I especially love the soothing
            harmony towards the end, around &quot;No we won&#39;t leave this
            town&quot;. It manages to evoke such a nostalgic feeling only
            Pinegrove is able to create. The exact feeling is quite
            indescribable. With that being said, I would rate this song a 5/5,
            without a doubt. I truly wish I could listen to it again for the
            first time

            Snowflake allows you to connect to the Tor network in places where Tor is blocked by routing your connection through volunteer proxies located in uncensored countries. 
            Simply enable the snowflake and leave this tab open in order to help circumvent censorship. Alternatively, install the extension!
