              >&quot;This is probably my favourite game; taking you through a
              rollercoaster of emotions with its stunning visuals and
              voiced-over story.&quot; - Myrdin</em

            This was the very first storygame I ever played, and I genuinely
            think everyone should give it a shot. It&#39;s totally worth your
            time. Over a few hours of gameplay, you dive into an incredible
            voiced-over story about life-challenges and how to deal with them
            all wrapped into a game with an a unique art-style. The game unfolds
            as a roughly four-hour emotional journey that really draws you in
            and connects you to the experience. Playing as a firewatch park
            ranger, you feel a sense of isolation that tends to stir up a lot of
            emotions. While many people seem to dislike the &quot;brutal&quot;
            ending, which hit me like a brick, I believe it&#39;s actually the
            best way to end the story.

            <em>&quot;The best hunting game I have played.&quot; - Myrdin</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This breathtaking game can be enjoyed both in singleplayer and
            co-op. The stunning visuals, a rewarding difficulty of gameplay,
            challenges and the ability to play this for hours on end make this
            an absolute recommendation. This game runs really smoothly, even on
            linux! I mostly enjoy this game together with friends, running
            around the various maps (DLC&#39;s) and hunting whatever we find :)
