            The English word <strong>bear</strong> has an intriguing history,
            rooted in fear, mythology, and a fascinating linguistic evolution.
            It derives from the Old English <em>bera</em>, which shares common
            ancestry with the names for bears in other Germanic languages, such
            as the (modern) Swedish term <em>björn</em> or the Dutch term
            <em>beer</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, the word <strong>bear</strong> is unrelated to what
            linguists consider the Proto-Indo-European term for bear:
            <em>h₂ŕ̥tḱos</em>. This ancient root gave rise to the Latin
            <em>ursus</em> and the Greek <em>ἄρκτος</em> (more on these later!).
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, <strong>bear</strong> originates from the
            Proto-Indo-European root <em>*bher-</em> (meaning
            &quot;brown&quot;), which evolved into the Proto-Germanic
            <em>*bero</em>, meaning &quot;the brown one,&quot; and eventually
            into the Old English <em>*bera</em>, which closely resembles the
            modern English word.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rise of this term is linked to a fascinating cultural
            phenomenon: <strong>taboo avoidance</strong>. Proto-Germanic tribes
            believed that calling the true name of the bear (<em>h₂ŕ̥tḱos</em>)
            might summon the powerful animal. To avoid this danger, they adopted
            euphemistic terms, leading to the creation of <em>*bero</em> and its
            linguistic descendants, including bear.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Germanic languages opted for euphemisms, other language
            families preserved the original name. Latin gave us
            <em>ursus</em> (which survives in the scientific term
            <em>Ursidae</em>), and Greek retained <em>ἄρκτος</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term <em>ἄρκτος</em> also plays a key role in the naming of the
            Arctic and Antarctic. The Arctic derives its name from the Greek
            <em>arktikos</em>, meaning &quot;of the bear,&quot; in reference to
            the constellation Ursa Major, the &quot;Great Bear,&quot; which is
            prominently visible in the northern sky. The Antarctic, on the other
            hand, literally means &quot;opposite the bear,&quot; as it refers to
            the southernmost region of the Earth, where Ursa Major is not
            visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bears have also left their mark on names and cultural symbols. For
            example, the name Ursula means &quot;little she-bear,&quot;
            popularized by the famous movie character. Germanic languages
            contribute names like Bernard (&quot;strong as a bear&quot;), the
            Swiss city of Bern (reportedly named after the first animal its
            founder hunted: a bear!), and the Old English Beowulf, a poetic
            kenning[^1] for bear that means &quot;bee-wolf.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The bear’s imposing presence has left its mark on our language,
            culture, and legends!
