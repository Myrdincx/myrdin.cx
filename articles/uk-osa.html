            What is the Online Safety Act (2023)?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Online Safety Act is a new UK law to make the internet safer,
            especially for children. It requires platforms to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Remove illegal content quickly</strong>, such as
              terrorism, child s*xual abuse, and fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Protect children from harmful material</strong>, such as
              p*rnography, self-harm content, and eating disorders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify users’ ages</strong> for risky content, using
              age-check systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Give Ofcom new powers to monitor</strong>, investigate,
              fine, or block services that don’t comply.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It applies to nearly all services with user-generated content that
              are accessible from the UK, even if they’re not based there.

            Why is the Online Safety Act so controversial?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Online Safety Act sounds reasonable on paper but in practice it
            is somewhat alarming:
          </p>
          <h4 id="1-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption">
            1. Threat to End-to-End Encryption
          </h4>
          <p>
            One of the most controversial parts of OSA is Section 122, which
            allows Ofcom to issue "technology notices"
            <sup><a href="#source-1" title="See source 1">[1]</a></sup
            >.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>What does that mean?</strong> <br />
              Platforms may be required to identify and remove content, even in
              private/encrypted communication.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This would force services like WhatsApp or Signal to implement
            client-side scanning, where messages are scanned before they&#39;re
            encrypted.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), this would be
            a direct attack on end-to-end encryption. In their article, they
            warn:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em
                >&quot;The OSB is a dangerous attempt to remake the internet.
                Instead of privacy, we will have age verification. Instead of
                security, we will have backdoors in end-to-end encryption. And
                instead of free speech, we will have scanning and filtering of
                all content, all the time.&quot;</em

          <h4 id="2-propaganda">2. Propaganda</h4>
          <p>
            The Online Safety Act has been marketed as a tool to protect
            children, something no reasonable person would be against:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Government messaging, press releases, and even the name of the Act
              itself focus on safety, not the broader surveillance that comes
              along with it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public statements frame OSA as necessary to &quot;make the UK the
              safest place in the world to be online&quot;
            </li>
            <li>
              Platforms are told they must &quot;do more” to stop harm, with
              little mention of <em>how</em>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But therein lies the issue, this framing is very selective: it
            creates the illusion of a protective law, without mentioning the
            broad censorship, forced age verification, and mass content
            monitoring that affects everyone, not just children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to the Patriot Act after 2001 (looking at you, USA), the
            Online Safety Act uses a moral panic to justify permanent structural
            changes to internet freedoms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &quot;Think of the children” is a powerful emotional appeal that
              shields OSA from criticism, even when legitimate concerns are
              raised about privacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Critics of OSA are often portrayed as being indifferent to child
              safety rather than concerned about civil/digital rights.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="3-information-handling">3. Information handling</h4>
          <p>
            The most overlooked aspect of the Online Safety Act is
            <em>who</em> actually handles your data, especially your
            verification process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, the verification process is often handled by private
            third-party companies, such as Persona, Yoti or Onfido. These
            companies require:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full face scans</li>
            <li>Government-issued ID documents</li>
            <li>
              Biometric data That is a massive amount of senstive, and very
              personal data often handed over to for-profit companies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These firms typically operate across borders and may store data on
            cloud servers outside the UK, exposing it to risks like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data breaches</li>
            <li>State surveillance (domestic or foreign)</li>
            <li>
              Commercial misuse or resale Even if a company claims not to store
              data permanently, you have no technical way to verify that. Once
              data is collected, you have lost any control over it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A real-world example: the Tea app breach
            <sup><a href="#source-3" title="See source 3">[3]</a></sup> exposed
            massive amounts of private user information even though they
            promised not to store any. Similar risks apply here, only at a
            national scale.

            is a browser that routes your traffic through multiple relays to

            however significantly slower than a VPN but does offer a higher
            level of anonymity.

          <h4 id="2-be-creative">2. Be Creative!</h4>
          <p>
            In the past, people have bypassed AI biometric verification tools by
            coming up with creative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was discovered that users could bypass AI-based face verification
            on Discord using images from the game <em>Death Stranding</em>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Discord required users to show their face to verify age or
              identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Death Stranding</em>’s hyper-realistic graphics fooled the AI;
              users passed the check using screenshots of characters in-game.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is obviously a
            <strong>proof-of-concept or loophole</strong> and probably won&#39;t
            work as a long-term method, but it does show how these systems can
            be easily fooled and are unfit for high-stakes verification.

            3. Choose open-source and privacy-respecting platforms
          </h4>
          <p>
            These platforms are more transparent by design: their code can be
            edited and viewed by anyone, reducing the risk of backdoors or
            extreme data collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            However,
            <strong>no platform is completely immune to breaches</strong>. Even
            open-source services suffer hacks or get pressured into handing over
            data.<br />Nonetheless, open-source and privacy-respecting platforms
            tend to offer better protections and user control than closed-source
            ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be cautious about services that require invasive ID verification or
            collect large amounts of personal data. Private companies handling
            sensitive info are often the targets for leaks. The ultimate goal is
            to look for solutions that minimise surveillance while maximising
            transparency.

            Moral questions and solutions
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this section, I want to make clear that I do support the sort of
            moral idea behind this Online Safety Act. Protecting users and
            especially children is of utmost importance. However, how it does
            that matters just as much as <strong>why</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>This Act pushes for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A surveillance-based internet</li>
            <li>Mandatory ID checks and scanning</li>
            <li>Censorship of legitimate speech</li>
            <li>Reliance on unaccountable private companies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We should not have to <strong>sacrifice privacy</strong> to feel
            safe, or <strong>give up encryption</strong> to protect the
            vulnerable. There are better, more respectful ways to build a safer
            internet — ones that empower users instead of controlling them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future should be open, transparent, community-driven forms of
            technology that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect encryption and privacy (by design)</li>
            <li>Allow users to control their own data</li>
            <li>Are open-source and decentralised</li>
            <li>Do not have invasive surveillance or censorship</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By supporting open platforms and holding lawmakers accountable, we
            can work toward an internet that’s both
            <strong>safe and free</strong>.
