          <p>
            The Online Safety Act is a new UK law to make the internet safer, especially for
            children. It requires platforms to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Remove illegal content quickly</strong>
              , such as terrorism, child s*xual abuse, and fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Protect children from harmful material</strong>
              , such as p*rnography, self-harm content, and eating disorders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify users’ ages</strong>
              for risky content, using age-check systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Give Ofcom new powers to monitor</strong>
              , investigate, fine, or block services that don’t comply.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It applies to nearly all services with user-generated content that are accessible from
              the UK, even if they’re not based there.

            Why is the Online Safety Act so controversial?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Online Safety Act sounds reasonable on paper but in practice it is somewhat
            alarming:

          <h4 id="1-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption">1. Threat to End-to-End Encryption</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most controversial parts of OSA is Section 122, which allows Ofcom to issue
            "technology notices".
            <sup><a href="#source-1" title="See source 1">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>What does that mean?</strong>
              <br />
              Platforms may be required to identify and remove content, even in private/encrypted
              communication.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This would force services like WhatsApp or Signal to implement client-side scanning,
            where messages are scanned before they&#39;re encrypted.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), this would be a direct attack on
            end-to-end encryption. In their article, they warn:
          </p>

                end-to-end encryption. And instead of free speech, we will have scanning and
                filtering of all content, all the time.&quot;

          </blockquote>
          <h4 id="2-propaganda">2. Propaganda</h4>
          <p>
            The Online Safety Act has been marketed as a tool to protect children, something no
            reasonable person would be against:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Government messaging, press releases, and even the name of the Act itself focus on
              safety, not the broader surveillance that comes along with it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public statements frame OSA as necessary to &quot;make the UK the safest place in the
              world to be online&quot;
            </li>
            <li>
              Platforms are told they must &quot;do more” to stop harm, with little mention of
              <em>how</em>
              .
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But therein lies the issue, this framing is very selective: it creates the illusion of a
            protective law, without mentioning the broad censorship, forced age verification, and
            mass content monitoring that affects everyone, not just children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to the Patriot Act after 2001 (looking at you, USA), the Online Safety Act uses
            a moral panic to justify permanent structural changes to internet freedoms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &quot;Think of the children” is a powerful emotional appeal that shields OSA from
              criticism, even when legitimate concerns are raised about privacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Critics of OSA are often portrayed as being indifferent to child safety rather than
              concerned about civil/digital rights.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="3-information-handling">3. Information handling</h4>
          <p>
            The most overlooked aspect of the Online Safety Act is
            <em>who</em>
            actually handles your data, especially your verification process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, the verification process is often handled by private third-party companies,
            such as Persona, Yoti or Onfido. These companies require:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full face scans</li>
            <li>Government-issued ID documents</li>
            <li>Biometric data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That is a massive amount of senstive, and very personal data often handed over to
            for-profit companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            These firms typically operate across borders and may store data on cloud servers outside
            the UK, exposing it to risks like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data breaches</li>
            <li>State surveillance (domestic or foreign)</li>
            <li>Commercial misuse or resale</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even if a company claims not to store data permanently, you have no technical way to
            verify that. Once data is collected, you have lost any control over it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A real-world example: Persona, the Online identity verification software retains the
            data indefinitely for audit and compliance purposes unless and until you, as the
            controller, tell them to delete the data.
            <sup><a href="#source-4" title="See source 4">[4]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another real-world example: the Tea app breach exposed massive amounts of private user
            information even though they promised not to store any.
            <sup><a href="#source-5" title="See source 5">[5]</a></sup>
            Similar risks apply here, only at a larger scale.
          </p>
          <h4 id="4-over-regulations">4. Over-regulations</h4>
          <p>
            The OSA doesn't just target illegal content, it pressures platforms to over-regulate
            anything that
            <em>might</em>
            be harmful, just to avoid fines. To stay compliant, platforms are likely to play it safe
            and remove or restrict more content than necessary.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of these over-regulations include but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spotify now requires users to verify their age before accessing songs with explicit
              lyrics. This can also affect podcasts that discuss sensitive topics, even in an
              educational way. There have been reports of users getting banned for failing age
              verification.
              <sup><a href="#source-6" title="See source 6">[6]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>
              Wikipedia, one of the greatest free knowledge projects ever created, has warned it may
              restrict or block pages with sensitive or explicit content, and has even threatened to
              block access to the site in the UK entirely.
              <sup><a href="#source-7" title="See source 7">[7]</a></sup>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This fear-driven approach leads platforms to block first, ask questions later, putting
            free speech and open access to knowledge at serious risk.

          <h4 id="2-be-creative">2. Be Creative!</h4>
          <p>
            In the past, people have bypassed AI biometric verification tools by coming up with
            creative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was discovered that users could bypass AI-based face verification on Discord using
            images from the game
            <em>Death Stranding</em>
            .
            <sup><a href="#source-9" title="See source 9">[9]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Discord required users to show their face to verify age or identity.</li>
            <li>
              <em>Death Stranding</em>
              ’s hyper-realistic graphics fooled the AI; users passed the check using screenshots of
              characters in-game.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is obviously a
            <strong>proof-of-concept or loophole</strong>
            and probably won&#39;t work as a long-term method, but it does show how these systems
            can be easily fooled and are unfit for high-stakes verification.

            . Even open-source services suffer hacks or get pressured into handing over data.
            <br />
            Nonetheless, open-source and privacy-respecting platforms tend to offer better
            protections and user control than closed-source ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be cautious about services that require invasive ID verification or collect large
            amounts of personal data. Private companies handling sensitive info are often the
            targets for leaks. The ultimate goal is to look for solutions that minimise surveillance
            while maximising transparency.

          <h3 id="moral-questions-and-solutions">Moral questions and solutions</h3>
          <p>
            In this section, I want to make clear that I do support the sort of moral idea behind
            this Online Safety Act. Protecting users and especially children is of utmost
            importance. However, how it does that, matters just as much as
            <em>why</em>
            .
          </p>
          <p>This Act pushes for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A surveillance-based internet</li>
            <li>Mandatory ID checks and scanning</li>
            <li>Censorship of legitimate speech</li>
            <li>Reliance on unaccountable private companies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We should not have to
            <strong>sacrifice privacy</strong>
            to feel safe, or
            <strong>give up encryption</strong>
            to protect the vulnerable. There are better, more respectful ways to build a safer
            internet, ones that empower users instead of controlling them.
          </p>
          <p>The future should be open, transparent, community-driven forms of technology that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect encryption and privacy (by design)</li>
            <li>Allow users to control their own data</li>
            <li>Are open-source and decentralised</li>
            <li>Do not have invasive surveillance or censorship</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By supporting open platforms and holding lawmakers accountable, we can work towards an
            internet that’s both
            <strong>safe and free</strong>
            .
